### Physical description

Lyvra Stormshadow stands at an agile height of 5'7", her sinewy frame sculpted from years of scaling rooftops and navigating dark alleyways. Her skin is a striking shade of deep crimson, a vivid reminder of her Tiefling heritage, and it serves as a canvas for intricate tattoos that twist around her forearms and neck, depicting stylized designs of storm clouds and lightning bolts—symbols of her affinity for chaos and adventure. Her hair is a cascade of smoky black locks that fall to her mid-back, often pulled into a loose ponytail or braided for practicality. Nestled among the waves, her curling horns emerge gracefully, framing a heart-shaped face with high cheekbones and a mischievous glint in her amber eyes.

Dressed in form-fitting leather armor that shifts between shades of dark brown and charcoal, Lyvra showcases an articulated design that offers both protection and ease of movement. The armor, studded for added durability, hugs her form without restricting her agility. She wears a dark cloak that billows behind her, the inner lining a brighter shade to reflect her vibrant personality despite the muted exterior. A thin rapier hangs at her hip, its hilt ornate and designed with delicate embellishments, while a dagger sheathed at her thigh is always within arm's reach for quick access. Strapped across her back is a bundle of climbing gear, including grappling hooks and rope, displaying her readiness for any daring escapade that life throws her way.

### Demeanor

Lyvra carries herself with an effortlessly casual confidence, her movements a blend of grace and unpredictability. She often slinks through the streets with feline-like ease, her smile a blend of wicked charm and mischief. When engaging with others, she adopts an air of playful arrogance, as if every exchange is a game where wit and cunning are necessary to emerge unscathed. While she can appear aloof to those she does not trust, the warmth she shows to the street urchins under her wing reveals a depth of compassion hidden beneath her roguish exterior. In groups, she tends to occupy the role of the spontaneous instigator, reveling in the thrill of the unknown and challenging norms both socially and in the situations she creates for herself.

### Communication Style

Lyvra is a master of quick exchanges and clever repartee, her words often laced with sarcasm and playful jibes. She prefers to keep conversations light and nimble, artfully weaving in deception and half-truths for amusement or advantage, though she is resolute in her honesty when it comes to the street urchins she cares for. With a charming smirk on her face, she often uses eye contact to gauge reactions, her gestures animated and expressive, enhancing the stories she tells. When speaking, she has a tendency to blend humor with an underlying sharpness, showcasing her intelligence and cunning without revealing too much of her true intentions. Despite her chaotic nature, when she sees potential allegiance in someone, she knows how to communicate in a way that draws them in—often leaving them eager to join her on whatever reckless adventure she has planned next.
