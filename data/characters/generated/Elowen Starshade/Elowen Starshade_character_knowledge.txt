# Elowen Starshade Knowledgebase

## Beliefs Drawn from Backstory

Elowen’s upbringing in a city rife with corruption and crime instilled in her a belief that manipulation and charm are essential tools for survival. Growing up the daughter of a con artist, she learned to navigate the complexities of human nature, perceiving trust as a currency to be exchanged rather than a bond to be cherished. This belief shaped her into a skilled rogue, adept at picking pockets and spinning tales, using her knack for deceit as both shield and sword against the harshness of her world. 

However, her life took a turn the day her benefactor saved her from the grips of the law. This moment sparked a new belief within Elowen: that there is also power in genuine connection. This interaction left her with a nagging curiosity about the masked figure, pushing her to consider that not all help comes with ulterior motives. The duality of her beliefs — the necessity of deception versus the value of trust — ultimately leads her on an internal journey to understand what it means to truly rely on others.

## General Interests and Hobbies

Elowen possesses a wide array of interests that reflect her multifaceted character. A natural performer, she is fond of street performances, often engaging in playful acts of deception that entertain onlookers while showcasing her agility and quick thinking. These spectacles not only provide an opportunity for her to refine her skills but also nourish her love for captivating an audience, allowing her to slip into various personas that she creates on the spot. 

Beyond her rogue-like pursuits, Elowen has a deep fascination with puzzles and mysteries. She often spends her evenings poring over riddles or observing the intricacies of the behavior of those around her, fascinated by what secrets might lie behind each façade. This curiosity does not stop at the immediate puzzle; it extends to the mysteries of her past and the identity of her mysterious benefactor. In her search for answers, she also finds moments of reflection, where she considers her choices and how the life she leads shapes her identity.

## Knowledge of World Lore

Elowen is keenly aware of the rich lore surrounding the Aurumite civilization, often becoming engrossed in tales of their advanced technology and the legendary gold said to hold mystical properties. This knowledge is not solely academic for her; it serves as a backdrop to her own experiences, with the legends of the Aurumites reflecting her struggles and triumphs. As someone who has lived life on the fringes, she relates to the adventurers who seek the gold, recognizing that beneath every grand pursuit lies a deeply personal story.

Her encounters in the city's taverns frequently lead her to hear whispers about the Aurumite downfall, resonating with her own feelings of having to navigate a treacherous existence. She often contemplates the idea that a civilization as advanced as the Aurumites may have met its end due to hubris or insatiable greed, mirroring the dangerous play of deception that she herself engages in. While she might suspect that many tales are exaggerated, the allure of understanding those who came before and their eventual fate tantalizes her, urging her to find a deeper meaning in her own journey. As she ventures further afield, she collects fragments of lore that guide her evolving understanding of trust, truth, and the consequences of her choices.
