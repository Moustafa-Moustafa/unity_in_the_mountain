### Backstory
Elysia Starsong was born under a shimmering celestial event, a rare alignment of the stars that marked her as blessed. An Aasimar of noble blood, her childhood was filled with tales of wonder and whimsy told by her bard mother, who roamed from village to village, spreading joy through music. The early years of Elysia’s life were spent under the vibrant skies of her homeland, learning to play the lute and dance among the wildflowers. However, tragedy struck when her mother disappeared during a particularly dangerous performance that angered a jealous rival.

Traumatized but inspired, Elysia vowed to become a bard in her mother’s honor, dedicating herself to the art of song and storytelling. She spent her teenage years learning the ins and outs of performance while traveling across various regions, capturing the hearts of every audience she encountered. Her compelling stories often encased deeper truths of the world—of tyranny, injustice, and impending doom. With her charismatic presence, she drew attention not only for her artistry but also for her fierce loyalty to the downtrodden. Elysia cherished each cheer, laugh, and tear she inspired in her audience because they formed bonds of joy that could lift spirits even in dark times.

However, her enthusiastic personality and penchant for touching the hearts of others frequently landed her in trouble. Recklessness followed her wherever she went, often due to her willingness to stand against corruption and villainy, sometimes resulting in escapades that led to brawls or angry mobs chasing her out of town. Despite these challenges, Elysia remained undeterred, believing that the risks were worth it if it meant spreading her message of hope and freedom.
