## Beliefs Drawn from Backstory

Elysia Starsong believes that music and storytelling hold the power to inspire change and uplift the downtrodden. Growing up in a world filled with tales and melodies from her bard mother, she learned to see the connections between art and emotional healing. Elysia is convinced that the heart can be swayed with a few well-placed notes and that laughter, joy, and shared experiences can bridge divides and mend wounds.

This belief is rooted in her childhood experiences, where her mother's performances brought joy to sorrowful hearts and transformed mundane gatherings into jubilant celebrations. The tragic loss of her mother serves as a driving force behind Elysia's conviction; she wishes to embody that same transformative power through her performance. Every cheer and tear from her audience becomes a piece of Elysia's mission to amplify hope and resistance against tyranny.

Elysia also holds a deep belief in the principles of freedom and justice. Her reckless pursuits stem from a strong moral compass urging her to stand against corruption and fight for those who cannot defend themselves. Witnessing the struggles of the oppressed ignited a fire within her, prompting her to embrace risks if it meant challenging authority and pursuing justice—even if it leads her into dangerous situations.

As her journey progresses, Elysia’s experiences with the consequences of her actions will lead her to temper her beliefs with newfound wisdom. While her passion for justice remains, she will learn that true freedom also includes responsibility; that a song or an act of rebellion must be balanced against the safety and well-being of her friends and those she seeks to protect.

## Knowledge of World Lore

Elysia knows about the Aurumite civilization and its renowned gold, fascinated by the artistry and lessons encapsulated in ancient relics from the past. She sees parallels between the Aurumites' legacy and her own pursuit of art as a medium for greater truths. Like scholars and historians drawn to the Aurumite artifacts, Elysia hopes to uncover the wisdom of their stories while intertwining her melodies with the echoes of the lost civilization.

Her belief in the transformative power of music often draws her curiosity toward various historical tales of the Aurumites.

Elysia is also aware of the opposing views regarding the Aurumite legends. While she aspires to embody the tenacity and artistry that may have defined their civilization, she is conscious of the skepticism that surrounds their existence.
