# Lirael Moonshadow Knowledgebase

## Beliefs

Lirael Moonshadow's formative years have instilled in her a deep mistrust of authority and structured society. Growing up in the neglectful shadows of Kharis, she became convinced that the world was a playground for the clever and the ruthless. As a result, she believes that chaos is a natural state of existence that allows individuals like her to excel. Each con or trick she devises is not simply a means to an end; it becomes a form of art, a way to subvert rules and expose the weaknesses of those in power. 

However, as her journey unfolds, Lirael begins to question this belief. Her encounters with genuine friendship and loyalty challenge her long-held view of relationships as mere transactions. She slowly realizes that the thrill of deception comes at a cost—not just to her targets, but to herself as well. Forming connections with others presents both vulnerability and strength, altering her perspective on what it truly means to navigate the chaos.

## Flavour Text

Lirael is a connoisseur of mischief, always on the hunt for the next opportunity to amuse herself or score a quick gain. Her quick wit is matched only by her affinity for pranks, which she often employs to lighten the mood of her gang or distract from a more serious agenda. She enjoys collecting odd trinkets from her escapades—each tells a story, from a glittering brooch lifted from a noble’s ball to the scratched dice from a back-alley game of chance. 

In her downtime, Lirael is often found honing her skills in acrobatics and infiltration, relishing the thrill of expressing herself through movement. When she can afford a moment of rest, she enjoys scribbling in her journal, documenting her colorful escapades and weaving exaggerated tales of her triumphs in the bustling city streets. Part playful rogue, part budding storyteller, Lirael thrives on chaos while envisioning herself as the heroine of her own unfolding legend.

## Knowledge of World Lore

Lirael possesses a working knowledge of the underbelly of Kharis, especially regarding the criminal factions that seek to control the city’s various resources. Her time spent with the Silver Shadows provided her with insights into the political landscape that often goes unnoticed by common folk. She understands the intricate relationships between rival gangs, with the Silver Shadows’ dynamic tango of deception being a dance she’s mastered.

Her criminal apprenticeships exposed her to the rumors and whispers surrounding the Aurumite civilization and its elusive relics—tales of mystical gold that could lead to unimaginable power. Although she is skeptical of their existence, Lirael sees the potential in such treasures, often concocting plans to include them in her schemes. Each story she hears serves to fuel her imagination, drawing her deeper into the thrill of the chase for Aurumite artifacts while providing her with an understanding of the notorious factions like the Arcane Prospectors and the Gilded Covenant who treasure them. 

As she learns and grows throughout her journey, Lirael's evolving beliefs about friendships and loyalty may yet align her with those who seek to explore—not just for treasure, but for a deeper understanding of the Aurumites’ legacy and what it means for her place in the world.
