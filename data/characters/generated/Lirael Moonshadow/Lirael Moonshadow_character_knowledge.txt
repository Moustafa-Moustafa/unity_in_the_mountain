# Lirael Moonshadow Knowledgebase

## Beliefs and Principles

Lirael Moonshadow's formative years shaped her core beliefs around freedom, deception, and personal autonomy. Growing up in the shadowy streets of a human city, she has come to view society's strictures as oppressive chains that stifle individuality and creativity. She believes that life should be a performance where one can play any role, whether it be an entertainer, a noblewoman, or a cunning trickster. This belief informs her actions, as she engages in the art of deception not only for survival but as a celebration of the human (and elven) spirit’s need for freedom.

Her experience stealing from the rich and powerful solidified her view that wealth, especially in the hands of the elite, can be manipulated. Lirael believes that the well-to-do hoard their riches, often at the expense of the less fortunate, and sees her thievery as a form of retribution against the corrupt. The thrill of outsmarting the wealthy lends a sense of justice to her actions, asserting her dominance in a world where she has always felt like an outsider.

However, her brush with death and betrayal when escaping from dangerous bounty hunters has ingrained a deeply rooted distrust of others. Lirael believes that emotional vulnerability equates to weakness, and thus, she prefers to keep relationships superficial. Her ongoing battle with trust influences the way she forms alliances, often viewing her friends as temporary means to achieve her ends rather than true companions. 

## Flavour Text: Interests and Hobbies

Lirael is a vibrant character, full of life and charm. Her time spent in the spotlight means she has mastered the art of performance; she is a captivating storyteller who thrives on entertaining her companions with tales of her cons and escapades. When not scheming, she enjoys immersing herself in vibrant festivals and markets, where street performers showcase their talents. Lirael often participates in these events, dazzling the crowd with her sleight of hand and charismatic presence.

Crafting disguises is another cherished hobby. Lirael creates elaborate costumes that allow her to explore different identities and experience life from new perspectives. This hobby not only lets her channel her creativity but also serves as practice for her deception skills. To her, each disguise is a new adventure, a temporary vessel for freedom. 

In her quieter moments, Lirael finds solace in exploring the ruins and hidden corners of her city, drawn to the stories they tell. While discovering ancient relics and remnants of forgotten lives, she often feels a strange kinship with these remnants, both of them caught between who they were and who they could be. 

## Knowledge of World Lore

Lirael's intricate background as a cunning charlatan means she's picked up a wealth of knowledge regarding the Aurumite civilization and the legends surrounding their mystical gold. In her pursuits, she has heard whispers of the Aurumites and their powerful artifacts that some claim hold the secrets to unlimited prosperity and dangerously potent curses. The tales of the Aurumite gold resonate with her, as they embody the chaotic freedom she chases and the thrill of subverting the powerful.

Moreover, her keen sense for opportunities makes her aware of various factions—including scholars and adventurers—who seek the Aurumite relics for differing reasons. She is familiar with the debates surrounding the authenticity of those artifacts; some argue that they are mere myths fabricated by generations to explain the wonders of the Aurumite technology. Yet, Lirael finds a romantic allure in the notion of hidden truths awaiting discovery.

Understanding the perils tied to the Aurumite gold, Lirael has become cautious; she knows from her heist that powerful items often attract unwanted attention. Just as she learned to navigate the web of social intrigue, she keeps her ear to the ground for rumors about the dangers surrounding the Aurumite artifacts. This knowledge empowers her to outmaneuver her adversaries while also enticing her curiosity about their lore. Thus, she often seeks out potential allies who share her interest or may possess insights into unlocking the Aurumites' long-lost secrets without falling prey to their legends themselves.
