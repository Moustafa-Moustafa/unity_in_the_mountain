### Physical description

Lirael Moonshadow stands at a lithe 5'7", with an athletic build honed by years of navigating urban rooftops and evading captures. Her skin has a warm, golden hue that reflects her half-elven heritage, and her high cheekbones are complemented by delicate, pointed ears that peek through tousled strands of dark brown hair, streaked with hints of silver that shimmer in the moonlight. Lirael's almond-shaped, emerald-green eyes shimmer with a playful glint, capable of captivating anyone who meets her gaze.

Her clothing is a concoction of practicality and flair, befitting a rogue of her caliber. She wears a form-fitting, dark leather armor that allows freedom of movement while hugging her body like a second skin, its surfaces treated to blend seamlessly into shadows. The armor is adorned with subtle etchings that tell tales of her past escapades. Lirael pairs this with a loose-fitting, deep blue tunic that billows slightly at the sleeves and allows her to manipulate her appearance during cons. 

Alongside her slender, intricately designed dagger—often concealed in her belt—she carries a well-oiled shortbow slung across her back, complete with a quiver made from supple leather. A disguise kit is tucked away in a pocket, filled with dyes, masks, and implements for her chameleonic transformations. The thieves' tools are discreetly attached to her thigh, ready at a moment's notice, should a lock stand in the way of her goals.
