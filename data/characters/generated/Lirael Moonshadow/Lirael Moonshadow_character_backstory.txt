### Backstory
Lirael Moonshadow was born to a human mother and an elven father, their love a fleeting romance that faded with the tides of time. Abandoned by her father after he returned to the elven realms, Lirael grew up in the bustling, shadowy streets of a human city, where she learned early on that survival depended on her wits and charm rather than brute strength. Her mother, an entertainer, taught her the art of performance, which Lirael amplified with her innate knack for deception.

At fifteen, Lirael became a true charlatan, using her talent for disguise and sleight of hand to con the wealthy out of their treasures. She would stroll into high-society gatherings disguised as a noblewoman, charming her way into the good graces of the elite before disappearing with their valuables. Despite her criminal activities, Lirael was deeply influenced by the teachings of freedom from societal constraints; to her, strict rules were chains that shackled creativity and joy.

Her real turning point came when she pulled off a heist involving a cursed artifact. Relying on her razor-wit and agile fingers, she lifted a powerful relic from a local lord, unaware that it was sought after by more dangerous individuals. The ensuing chaos almost cost her life when bounty hunters closed in, revealing her deep-seated trust issues. Just as she felt cornered, she found unlikely allies in a band of outcasts who shared her disdain for authority. 

Since that day, she has walked a fine line between criminality and companionship, taking care to protect her few true friends while maintaining her independence. Though she thrives in her chaotic lifestyle, her past haunts her, especially when it comes to trusting others.
