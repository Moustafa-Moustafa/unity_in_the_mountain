### Backstory
Elowen Starwhisper was born during a rare celestial event, when the moons aligned and the stars twinkled like diamonds against a velvet sky, an omen that marked her as special. As a half-elf child in a small village at the edge of an expansive forest, she was often caught between two worlds: that of the elves, who viewed her as an outsider, and that of humans, who found her ears and grace captivating but also alien. 

Her mother, a revered herbalist, taught her the ways of the forest, imparting ancient wisdom about the plants and animals that thrived around them. However, tragedy struck when her mother fell ill due to an unknown blight that crept into their land. Despite her mother's teachings, Elowen could not save her. Out of grief and guilt, she retreated into the wilderness, seeking solace among trees and streams. This time as a hermit allowed her to forge a deep connection with nature itself. It became her friend, confidante, and source of guidance.

Years passed, and at the heart of her solitude, Elowen discovered an injured wolf caught in a hunterâ€™s trap. Rescuing the creature ignited a spark of purpose within her. The wolf, whom she named Asher, became her companion and guardian, possessing a fierce loyalty that mirrored Elowen's own connection to the earth. However, despite her newfound companionship, Elowen struggled to reconcile her disdain for civilization with her desire to protect her home from encroaching threats. 

Deep down, Elowen knew that the balance of nature and civilization was delicate, and while she wished to isolate herself from the structures of mankind, she understood that she would have to confront the darkness that lay within it.
